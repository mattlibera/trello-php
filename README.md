# Trello PHP - Laravel Fork

This is a fork of Steven Maguire's Trello PHP library, specifically designed for Laravel 5.4.

For now I've just gotten the `$_SESSION` variables overridden for Laravel, but in the future I may end up going further with this.

For the original README file, please see: [README-ORIG.md](README-ORIG.md)
